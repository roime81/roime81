### AI Factory

As mentioned by [Dr. Susara van den Heever](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ai-factory-1cefb5b309d)
_Just like a physical factory creates physical products, reliably at scale and at speed, an AI Factory delivers AI solutions for business — reliably at scale and at speed. An AI Factory combines data, people, process, product and platform to move beyond science experiments and deliver AI that drives business value. The AI Factory builds on the importance of creating a solid information architecture for sustained AI success. It combines DataOps, ModelOps, and MLOps to accelerate AI innovations to market._
