### Data-as-a-Service

_Data as a service (DaaS) is a business model where data is made available on demand and regardless of the consumerâ€™s location or infrastructure. To enable DaaS, organizations provide cloud-based software for analyzing and managing the accessed data._

* To have DaaS in Azure, diagram above used to implement end-to-end data ingestion and processing. Assumed data are ingested from on-prem database server, Azure Data Factory used to establish ingestion pipelines.
* Data will transformed from from raw to curated / processed in Data Factory. Data then saved in SQL database.  
* Besides ADF, Databricks can be used to ingest data, using Python or R.
* Since there are more than 1 pipelines and severals curated data stored, Synapse is used to form a DWH, that aggregates, integrates multiple curated data sources.
* End users than connected to Synapse using data endpoint created.
* Besides SQL, data also can be stored in preferred storage e.g PostgreSQL, Blob, Data Lake.
